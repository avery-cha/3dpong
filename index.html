    <div class="instructions-text">
       The rules are the same as the classic game of pong. Use your mouse to control your paddle. Hit the ball onto your opponents
      side and prevent it from getting past your paddle. Score points by hitting the ball past your opponent.
      Advance to the next level by scoring three points. The game is over if three points are scored against you.
