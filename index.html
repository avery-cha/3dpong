       The rules are the same as the classic game of pong. Use your mouse to control your paddle. Hit the ball onto your opponents
      side and prevent it from getting past your paddle. Score points by hitting the ball past your opponent. Win the game by scoring ten points. The game is over if ten points are scored against you.
